Exploring Amsterdam Airbnb Data and writing a blogpost

### Project Motivation
I am doing this analysis , as a part of Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree. The dataset chosen is publicly available on Airbnb.
In this repository, I analysed the Airbnb data for Amsterdam. I tried to find answers to the following business questions ,using the data-
1. What is number of new listings posted on Airbnb for Amsterdam, on a year to year basis ?
2. What is the distribution of prices in Amsterdam Airbnb listings ?
3. Which features contibute the most in predicting prices of listings ?

### Summary
In general, I found that The majority of listings are less than $400 .The accomodate feature and availability_365 feature contribute most towards predicting prices of listings. The number of new listings saw a sharp increase between 2008 -2014 period.Therafter, there has been a declining trend in number of new listings
